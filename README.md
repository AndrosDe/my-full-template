First Gitpod Project
This is the first project that we've created in the Gitpod editor. This project is display the technologies that will used throughout this program in a small little dashboard.
And I added extra stuff for fun and giggles.
The purpose of this is that we get an understanding of how to find our around the Gitpod editor

Technologies Used
In this project we used some simple HTML5 and CSS3 to build the project, and we wrote our code using Gitpod.
