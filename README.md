# First Github Project and Website

## Welcome!

### [My First Template Website](https://androsde.github.io/my-full-template/)

<hr>

This is the first project that I've created in the Gitpod editor. This project is a display of the technologies that will be used throughout Full-Stack Developer-Program at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) in a small little dashboard.

The purpose of this is that we get an understanding of how to find our around the Gitpod editor.

I added an additional website (portfolio-forbitten.html) as an extra challange to go beyond the steps in the course and for fun and giggles.

That way I was able to do more trouble shooting, when some styles, links and the navigation bar failed to work at first.
Also it forced me to do a lot more cleaning up with "git rm".

### Features
<br>

#### A Navigation Bar
This very basic webside has a navigation bar to all 4 pages to allow the user to easily navigate from page to page without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
<br>

#### Links
It features links to the Wikipedia or "About Page" of the respected technologies or to pictuers.
These will all open in a new tap, so that the user can stay on the website and can come back to it by switch in the browser tab.

### Technologies Used
In this project we used some simple HTML5 and CSS3 to build the project, and we wrote our code using Gitpod.
